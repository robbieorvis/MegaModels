MegaModels Testing Notes

EXTERNAL V2.0 TESTING NOTES

-volatility in natural gas prices built into base scenario?
-Event where a new distribution utility/company appears and reduces load?
-Add output on get started that exports team name to check (Team 1 team name)
-change font size and colors on the summary page
-double check that CT contributes to the next round
-Once a policy is selected, grey out option or set as always on
**-Round 4 to 5 in the export version of the sheet is referencing round 4**
-Enabled policies on gameplay screen for PIMs/ESM


INTERNAL V1.61 TESTING NOTES

-Add earnings sharing mechanism by reducing in half the amount of revenue at stake in PBR models
-Fix formula on utility revnue sheet that determines revenue available from PBR
-Make sure payments under PBR are allocated to customers
-Add in requirements for restructured utilities to meet resource adequacy requirements
-Add in "most you can support without building more flexible resources"
-Change text in pop-up for building is that "you can build up to 4 times your current generation mix"
-Add in pie charts for existing capacity in round summary box
-soft stop on resource adequacy when under restructured
-Fix distribution amount buildable name range
-Fix reliability additional transmission built (referencing c100 not c99)
-RoR for restructured utilities on transmission should be equal to WACC


INTERNAL V1.44 TESTING NOTES
-Intro Page
	-Remove the word "Regulatory" from biz model description (check if this is possible without destroying the game); can't do this
	-Change the text to from 10 years to 5 rounds (10 years)
	-Typo in profitability
	-word wrap the first question and question 4
	- change text from "build too quickly" to if you don't "you'll need to make sure the system is flexible enough to integrate these"
	-"How will you take advantage of these cheap new sources of power"
-Gameplay
	-Lower batteries (reliability) to 10 MW installed
	-Reduce distribution system infrastcure flexibility points per resource from 0.01 to 0.005 or lower
	-Change capacity build "solar" to "utility scale solar"
	-Cancel on Add Policy doesn't work
	-Increase fixed charges isn't offsetting the amount that goes to variable charges on the utility revenue sheet
	-double check utility revenue sheet to make sure it's not double counting costs
	-Check the efficiency installation effect on EPS
	-Turn on limitation on advancing if not enough capacity in vertical
	-Reliability not being improved from extra distribution system infrastructure
	-Buildling distriution system infrastructure not getting added on Reliability sheet
	-Change customer bill print out axis to zero not dynamic
	-make shares dynamic based on type of biz model
	-for wind and solar generation lower the buildable increments size
	- vertically align resource constraints box
	- fix distribution system infrastructure interval
	- widen balancing area multiplier turning on for all rounds when activated
	- Add PTC and ITC for utility scale wind and solar
	- "Advance to next round" for final turn should say something else
	- disable performance incentive mechanism policy when in PBR
